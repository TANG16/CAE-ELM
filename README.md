To run this code on your computer. You need to convert your 3D shape into 2 types: voxel and sdf data.  
If you only have *.off files or dirs, you can copy ./readdata/getsdfdata/* and ./readdata/getvoxeldata/* to your off dirs, then run the "runexe.m" to generate voxel data and sdf data.
After that, you can copy the sdfdata.mat and voxeldata.mat to ./data, and add the path in "run_fea_combine.m". Then run "run_fea_combine.m".# CAE-ELM
